Thank you everyone for the presence. Im gonna briefly present the work that Ive been developing as a postdoctoral research here at Texas A&M and under the supervision of Dr. Daru

## Time travel

???
So to start, this is basically one of the things that must fascinate, the possibility to go back to the past and, based on this, understand what we have in the present days. This inhabits our minds for decades

For example, take a look of this picture, and the conclusion is pretty clear. We can understand what happened before just looking at a tiny timeslice

### Numerical tools: development of model-based phylogenetic metrics


.pull-left[

- How can we differentiate between historical dispersal and diversification (speciation + extinction)?

- estimating the range of species through **ancestral area reconstruction**

- **decomposing**  evolutionary history that comes from **dispersal events** and from **diversification**
]

???
Basically, the diversity metrics measured at local or regional scales cannot differentiate between processes associated with dispersal and diversification. So, we could first, estimate the range of species through ancestral area reconstruction, and based on this reconstruction we can decompose the evolutionary history of set of species based on the amount of this evolutionary history that emerged from dispersal events, and the amount of evolutionary history that emerged from diversification processes

```
]


???
So, the question is, if the metrics of phylogenetic diversity cannot offer a reliable interpretation of past events shaping biological assemblages, how can we consider the evolutionary history acting in different scales, particularly a regional/local scale?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.alt= "A painting illustrating Darwin's finches" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/Jetz_age_arrival.png")
```

???
Here we can see that looking at just the traditional metrics we can see that we take the risk to underestimate the role of amazon assemblages in maintain through time the phylogenetic endemism for these bird assemblages. Since Amazon corresponds to a region in which the phylgoeentic endemism is almost all genereted through in-situ speciation

In a closer look we can see how much each biome contributes as a source of species to other biomes, for example, the Amazon biome contribures mainly as a source of species to biomes in the central america
